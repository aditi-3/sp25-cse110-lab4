#### 1. What was the bug?

    The bug occured because result was type string, so the two numbers were being added as strings instead of integers.

#### 2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.

    I converted num1 and num2 to an integer using parseInt().
